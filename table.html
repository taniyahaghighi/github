                <hr>
                <p>GitHub is an American company that provides hosting for software development version control using
                    Git. It is a subsidiary of Microsoft, which acquired the company in 2018 for $7.5 billion.[4] It
                    offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git
                    as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features
                    such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.[5]

                    GitHub offers plans for free, professional, and enterprise accounts.[6] Free GitHub accounts are
                    commonly used to host open source projects.[7] As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private
                    repositories to all plans, including free accounts.[8] As of May 2019, GitHub reports having over 37
                    million users[9] and more than 100 million repositories[10] (including at least 28 million public
                    repositories),[11] making it the largest host of source code in the world.[12]</p>

                    GitHub at AWS Summit
                    GitHub was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby
                    on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed since 2007 and is
                    located in San Francisco.[13]


                    The shading of the map illustrates the number of users as a proportion of each country's Internet
                    population. The circular charts surrounding the two hemispheres depict the total number of GitHub
                    users (left) and commits (right) per country.
                    On February 24, 2009, GitHub team members announced, in a talk at Yahoo! headquarters, that within
                    the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of
                    which were formed in the previous month alone. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been
                    forked at least once and 4,600 had been merged.

                    On July 5, 2009, GitHub announced that the site was now harnessed by over 100,000 users. On July 27,
                    2009, in another talk delivered at Yahoo!, Preston-Werner announced that GitHub had grown to host
                    90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000
                    repositories.[14]

                    On July 25, 2010, GitHub announced that it was hosting 1 million repositories.[15] On April 20,
                    2011, GitHub announced that it was hosting 2 million repositories.[16]
